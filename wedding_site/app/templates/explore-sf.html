              <p><b>Dolores Park:</b> All of San Francisco's neighborhoods and groups in one park.  
			  Grab a bite nearby and bring it to the park to enjoy.  If you climb to the top, you 
			  get a great view of downtown. </p>
			  <p><b>Golden Gate Park:</b> You can spend an entire day (or two) just in this park.  
			  Many of the roads are closed to traffic on the weekends leave it a perfect place to bike,
			  run or walk.  The De Young Museum and the California Academy of Science call the park home
			  as does the Japanese Tea Garden and the Conservatory of Flowers.</P>
			  <p><b>The Presidio:</b> A former military base, this park is slowly but surely being 
			  transformed. People still live, work and play here.  You can get great views of the 
			  Golden Gate Bridge from Crissy Field and you will see lots of people who have rented 
			  bikes to bike over the bridge and back (or taking a ferry back from Sausalito).</p>
			  <p><b>Glen Park Canyon:</b> This is a more rugged park, great for hiking and feeling 
			  like you have left the city behind.</p>
			  <p><b>Bernal Hill Park:</b> You and a one hundred of the city's canine residents will 
			  enjoy a great 360 degree view of San Francisco and the surrounding area.  On a clear day
			  you can see both the Golden Gate and Bay bridges as well as Mount Tamalpais to in the north
			  bay and Mount Diablo in the east bay. </p>
